                        Peter Benjamin Parker was born in Queens to Richard and Mary Parker. While Peter was still an infant, his parents were
                        assigned by the CIA to infiltrate the Algerian based spy ring controlled by the communist agent, the Red Skull. The
                        moment the Red Skull learned that Richard and Mary were double agents, he had them killed by one of his agents, the
                        Finisher, in an airplane crash overseas and then framed them for treason.[38] Before their deaths however, Richard and
                        Mary had another child unknown to all others including Peter himself, a daughter and Peter's younger sister,
                        Teresa.
