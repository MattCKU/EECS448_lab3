    <p ID="para" cite="http://contra.wikia.com/wiki/Konami_Code">The Konami Code (コナミコマンド Konami Komando?, lit. "Konami Command") is a special combination of buttons that appears
        in several Konami games. It was widely popularized due to its inclusion in the original Contra video game,
        where it allowed the player to obtain 30 free lives. Since it was first revealed, the code has become part of
        popular culture in general, even appearing in many non-Konami games and diverse media, such as clothing,
        advertisements and non-gaming related software.</p>
